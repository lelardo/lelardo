### 💼 What I've worked on
I enjoy building things that actually work, whether they are simple tools or more complete systems.

* **Mobile Apps:** I’ve built several apps using **Flutter**, from basic ones to more functional projects.
* **SQL Databases:** I’m really comfortable here. I enjoy designing and managing relational databases.
* **Web Projects:** I’ve worked on web apps that need a solid **Backend** to run properly.
* **Full-Stack:** I like handling both sides, from the user interface to the server and data.
